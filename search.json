    "text": "Current projects\nWorking Paper: Continuity in Germany’s electoral Geography since the German Empire\n\nI assess the degree of continuity in spatial patterns of voting across 130 years. I conduct a spatial analysis by combining historical and contemporary census and electoral data through spatial interpolation. Based on cleavage theory, I can show how traditional parties still benefit from spatial continuities in the distribution of ‘cleavage groups’. Continuity in the electoral geography have been sustained by a religious geography that has remained fairly stable."
