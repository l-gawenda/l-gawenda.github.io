I conduct a spatial analysis by combining historical and contemporary census and electoral data through spatial interpolation. Building on cleavage theory, my findings suggests that continuity in the electoral geography has primarily been sustained through the religious geography which has remained fairly stable.\n\nData  A new boundary file of electoral districts of Imperical Germany (1870-1912)\nWorking paper  Does the environment matter? Environmental salience and political support across 28 middle and high-income countries\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe study examines the salience of environmental issues. I review the current literature on political salience and propose a novel definition of issue salience, both, at the public (national) and personal (individual) level. Combinding national-level indicators and individual-level survey data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP, 1993-2020), I show how the support for environmental protection is strongly related to environmental salience. Based on random slope multilevel regression models, the results suggest that support for environmental protection hinges on the the public salience of environnmental issues."
