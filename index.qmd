## Welcome!
I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Sociology at Bielefeld University (Working Group Quantitative Methods). I work at the [SOEP RegioHub](https://lsc-soep-regiohub.com/), a project funded by the Leibniz Foundation, the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) and Bielefeld University.

In my research, I study geographical patterns of political participation and their history. More generally, I am a sociologist and political scientist interested in political participation, party politcs and environmental sociology. 
I predominantly work with electoral and survey data using quantitative methods.
