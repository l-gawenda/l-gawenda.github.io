## Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Sociology at Bielefeld University. I work at the [SOEP RegioHub](https://lsc-soep-regiohub.com/), a project funded by the Leibniz Foundation, the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) and Bielefeld University.

I study spatial patterns of political participation and their history. More generally, I am a political scientist and sociologist interested in political participation, party politcs and environmental politics. I predominantly work with electoral and survey data using quantitative methods.

## Current projects:

**Working paper**  Continuity in Germany's electoral Geography since the German Empire

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

I assess the degree of continuity in spatial patterns of voting across 130 years. I conduct a spatial analysis by combining historical and contemporary census and electoral data through spatial interpolation. Building on cleavage theory, my findings suggests that continuity in the electoral geography has primarily been sustained through the religious geography which has remained fairly stable.

**Data**  A collection of historical election and social-structure data for Imperial Germany (1870-1912)
<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Current data sets lack accurate shapefiles and accurate social-structural data. I compile a data collection, that collects all available data from the German Reich at with corresponding shapefiles. This includes newly digitized shapefiles.

**Working paper**  Does the environment matter? Environmental salience and political support across 28 middle and high-income countries

<details>

<summary>Abstract</summary>

The study examines the salience of environmental issues. I review the current literature on political salience and propose a novel definition of issue salience, both, at the public (national) and personal (individual) level. Combinding national-level indicators and individual-level survey data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP, 1993-2020), I show how the support for environmental protection is strongly related to environmental salience. Based on random slope multilevel regression models, the results suggest that support for environmental protection hinges on the the public salience of environnmental issues.
